The **MegamVertice Console (UI - Nilavu)** is the main way to launch and manage virtual machines. A command line facility will be issued in our future launch.

### Getting Started

Enter MegamVertice Console (UI - nilavu) by typing [https://localhost](https://localhost) in the browser.

Replace *localhost* with *your ip*

Click on the virtual machine that was just launched.

This will open the *management page*.
